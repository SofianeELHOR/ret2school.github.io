      <description>Aero CTF 2021 - BashD00r (500 pts) This is the second challenge I was able to solve, and the hardest one. The task is below:
 There seems to be something wrong with our bash.
Can you see if anyone has entered the backdoor?
bash.7z
 So we are given a archive, which contains a &amp;ldquo;bash&amp;rdquo; binary. This binary was backdoored, so we need to find it to get the flag.</description>

      <description>Aero CTF 2021 - Dummyper (454 pts) This the first challenge I did. The challenge&amp;rsquo;s task was:
 This stupid program has encrypted our flag.
We only have a dump left.
 With a mysterious &amp;ldquo;dump.7z&amp;rdquo; that contains a &amp;ldquo;dump&amp;rdquo; file. This file is an ELF binary, so we load it in IDA.
Overview IDA complains about broken section table, but still succeeds to load the bin. We get classical glibc&amp;rsquo;s __libc_start_main, and the &amp;ldquo;main&amp;rdquo; function which looks like this:</description>

      <description>UnionCTF - Unionware This challenge gives us two files: an &amp;ldquo;unionware.ps1&amp;rdquo; and a &amp;ldquo;important_homework.txt.unionware&amp;rdquo; containing seemingly random bytes. The challenge tells us that a ransomware encrypted the important homework and asks us to decrypt it.
Analyzing the Powershell While looking at the powershell, we can see an obfuscated Powershell command, which seems to split some random string and then evaluating it. So, we&amp;rsquo;ll just run the part of the script which deobfuscates the payload without executing it, which give us:</description>

      <description>The binary can be found right here.
[UnionCTF] Babyrarf Welcome guys,
This Write-Up is about de first pwn challenge of unionctf: babyrarf. It was a really easy challenge with a stack based buffer overflow. The source code was provided so, no need to reverse the binary :).
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a look at the src!
#include &amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;stdint.h&amp;gt;#include &amp;lt;unistd.h&amp;gt; typedef struct attack { uint64_t id; uint64_t dmg; } attack; typedef struct character { char name[10]; int health; } character; uint8_t score; int read_int(){ char buf[10]; fgets(buf, 10, stdin); return atoi(buf); } void get_shell(){ execve(&amp;#34;/bin/sh&amp;#34;, NULL, NULL); } attack choose_attack(){ attack a; int id; puts(&amp;#34;Choose an attack:\n&amp;#34;); puts(&amp;#34;1.</description>

      <description>Hi
This is my write up for the challange Cuba of CSAW CTF 2020 :
So this challenge is a CUBA program wrapped in a Windows Executable. CUBA is a GPU langage created by NVIDIA to work around GPU with high performance langage.
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html
Luckily there is a public SDK for it, with a disassembler :
https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-binary-utilities/index.html
Using a tool called cuobjdump, we can extract the assembly code :
To extract ptx text from a host binary, use the following command: cuobjdump -ptx &amp;lt;host binary&amp;gt;  And after reversing the output, we can see that it&amp;rsquo;s a simple xor looping through a ciphered flag</description>
